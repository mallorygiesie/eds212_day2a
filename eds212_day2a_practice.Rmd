## Derivative Practice
Find the derivative of $f(x) = 5x^2$
```{r}
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2)

my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")

x <- seq(from = 2.8, to = 5.7, by = .1)

eval(my_derivative)
```
Find the slope of $g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$
```{r}

gz <- expression(2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)

dg_dz <- deriv(gz, "z")
dg_dz

z<- c(1,2,3)

eval(dg_dz)
```
